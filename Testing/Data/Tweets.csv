neutral,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?

negative,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."

negative,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
negative,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
negative,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty

negative,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
negative,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
negative,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
negative,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
negative,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.

negative,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
negative,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?

negative,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
negative,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
negative,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
negative,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
negative,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
neutral,@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
negative,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.

negative,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?

negative,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
negative,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
negative,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"

negative,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
positive,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
negative,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
negative,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
negative,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
negative,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
negative,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
negative,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
neutral,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
negative,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
negative,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.

negative,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
negative,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.

negative,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
negative,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.

negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
